cti-taxii-client
================

NOTE: This is an `OASIS TC Open Repository
<https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`_. See the
`Governance`_ section for more information.

cti-taxii-client is a minimal client implementation for the TAXII 2.X server.
It supports the following TAXII 2.X API services:

- Server Discovery
- Get API Root Information
- Get Status
- Get Collections
- Get a Collection
- Get Objects
- Add Objects
- Get an Object
- Delete an Object (2.1 only)
- Get Object Manifests
- Get Object Versions (2.1 only)

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install the TAXII client is with pip

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install taxii2-client

Usage
-----

The TAXII client is intended to be used as a Python library.  There are no
command line clients at this time.

``taxii2-client`` provides four classes:

- ``Server``
- ``ApiRoot``
- ``Collection``
- ``Status``

Each can be instantiated by passing a `url`, and (optional) `user` and
`password` arguments. The authorization information is stored in the instance,
so it need not be supplied explicitly when requesting services. By default, the
latest version of the supported spec will be imported. If you need a specific
version you can perform the following:

.. code-block:: python

   from taxii2client.v21 import Server
   server = Server('https://example.com/taxii2/', user='user_id', password='user_password')

Once you have instantiated a ``Server`` object, you can get all metadata about
its contents via its properties:

.. code-block:: python

   print(server.title)

This will lazily load and cache the server's information in the instance:

- ``api_roots``
- ``title``
- ``description``
- ``default`` (i.e. the default API root)
- ``contact``

You can follow references to ``ApiRoot`` objects,
``Collection`` objects, and (STIX) objects in those collections.

.. code-block:: python

   api_root = server.api_roots[0]
   collection = api_root.collections[0]
   collection.add_objects(stix_bundle)

Each ``ApiRoot`` has attributes corresponding to its meta data

- ``title``
- ``description``
- ``max_content_length``
- ``collections``

Each ``Collection`` has attributes corresponding to its meta data:

- ``id``
- ``title``
- ``description``
- ``alias`` (2.1 only)
- ``can_write``
- ``can_read``
- ``media_types``

A ``Collection`` can also be instantiated directly:

.. code-block:: python

    # Performing TAXII 2.0 Requests
    from taxii2client.v20 import Collection, as_pages

    collection = Collection('https://example.com/api1/collections/91a7b528-80eb-42ed-a74d-c6fbd5a26116')
    print(collection.get_object('indicator--252c7c11-daf2-42bd-843b-be65edca9f61'))

    # For normal (no pagination) requests
    print(collection.get_objects())
    print(collection.get_manifest())

    # For pagination requests.
    # Use *args for other arguments to the call and **kwargs to pass filter information
    for bundle in as_pages(collection.get_objects, per_request=50):
        print(bundle)

    for manifest_resource in as_pages(collection.get_manifest, per_request=50):
        print(manifest_resource)

    # ---------------------------------------------------------------- #
    # Performing TAXII 2.1 Requests
    from taxii2client.v21 import Collection, as_pages

    collection = Collection('https://example.com/api1/collections/91a7b528-80eb-42ed-a74d-c6fbd5a26116')
    print(collection.get_object('indicator--252c7c11-daf2-42bd-843b-be65edca9f61'))

    # For normal (no pagination) requests
    print(collection.get_objects())
    print(collection.get_manifest())

    # For pagination requests.
    # Use *args for other arguments to the call and **kwargs to pass filter information
    for envelope in as_pages(collection.get_objects, per_request=50):
        print(envelope)

    for manifest_resource in as_pages(collection.get_manifest, per_request=50):
        print(manifest_resource)

In addition to the object-specific properties and methods, all classes have a
``refresh()`` method that reloads the URL corresponding to that resource, to
ensure properties have the most up-to-date values.
